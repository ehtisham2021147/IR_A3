Evaluation of Recommendation Models using MovieLens-1M Dataset
This assignment focuses on implementing and comparing two recommendation system models — a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and a Simulated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) — using the MovieLens-1M dataset. The objective is to evaluate how well these models can predict user preferences and rank unseen movies accurately.

Dataset:
Source: MovieLens-1M (from Kaggle)

Preprocessing:

Ratings ≥ 4.0 were considered positive interactions.

User and movie IDs were encoded to sequential indices.

A negative sampling strategy was applied to generate implicit negative feedback by randomly selecting items a user has not interacted with.

Models Trained:
MLP Model: Uses user and item embeddings concatenated and passed through fully connected layers to predict the probability of interaction.

Simulated CNN Model: Mimics CNN behavior by passing reshaped embeddings through a 1D convolutional layer followed by a fully connected classifier.

Training:
Both models were trained for 5 epochs using binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

Training was done on both positive and negative samples to enable binary classification.

Evaluation Metrics:
Recall@10: Measures how many of the actual liked movies appeared in the top-10 recommendations.

NDCG@10 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain): Measures both relevance and ranking quality of the top-10 items recommended.

Results:
Metric	MLP Model	CNN Model
Recall@10	0.0702	0.0807
NDCG@10	0.1334	0.1419

The CNN model outperformed the MLP on both metrics, indicating that the simulated CNN architecture was better at learning user–item interaction patterns under the given setup.
